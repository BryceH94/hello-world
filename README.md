Hello World Project to Learn the Basics of GitHub

I'm writing a bit about myself because the "Hello World" project told me to. Real creative, I know.
I wonder if branches can have branches?
Do you think suede shoes go with my chamomile tea? Or should I go for the wooden clogs?
I wonder if all programmers think they're quirky and funny. Self burn, once I become a programmer that is. 
This reminds me of le random spork copy pasta. What filth. Holds up spork, stabs own eye.
